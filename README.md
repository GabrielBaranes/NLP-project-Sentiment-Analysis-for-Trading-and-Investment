  This research project offers an NLP model to analyze the investor sentiment in
stock markets. Investor behavior, which depends in particular on market sentiment, may
not be the same across markets. For a variety of reasons, information on listed
companies may vary from one country to another. This may allow explaining why a
company's stock price may differ across stock markets. This issue is particularly acute
for multi-listed companies.

  In the digital era, financial information is abundant and available in a wide
variety of digital media. This makes difficult an exhaustive analysis of the information.
This can be greatly facilitated by the use of Machine Learning and NLP tools. These
tools enable information to be processed rapidly and made efficiently available to
investors. For instance, traders can thus use the structured data provided by NLP tools
and refine their trading strategies. The research project is part of this context and
provides a tool for processing information and building a sentiment analysis.

  After presenting some key concepts related to the analysis of financial markets,
we give a brief overview of the sentiment analysis and the BERT model. We then build
a model that assesses the overall sentiment expressed in news about a company in two
different countries.
